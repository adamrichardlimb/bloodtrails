# Bloodtrails

This addon makes it so blood decals in TTT are scannable with a DNA scanner.

## Notes

TTT creates a lot of blood splatter, so to save memory:
- Blood splatters that overlap with each other are ovewritten by the latest blood splatter.
- Blood splatters will decay after 30 seconds and be unusable.
